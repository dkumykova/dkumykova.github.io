        Lights bounced off regal marble walls, creating a near blinding spectacle of light. The walls soared overhead, arching and greeting each other at a delicately threatening chandelier. Dizzying patterns of Celtic knots littered the glossy floor, and all along the hall stood little peculiar creatures speaking in gruff, unfriendly voices.
    It was interesting, to say the least, to see these little hairy men with permanently grumpy dispositions talking business and money with elegantly clad magus (for that’s what they must be). In fact, the creatures were a bit intimidating, but nevertheless she was determined to find a way to this mystical school.
    Artemis squared her shoulders, checked to make sure that her ragged trousers and tunic were smooth as possible, and marched up to the first open creature. Upon closer inspection, there was even a greenish tinge to its skin, and its teeth were wicked and white.
    “What is it that you need?” the being asked nastily.
    Refusing to be fazed, Artemis replied in turn. “Good morning-ah, what did you say your name was?”
    “I didn’t,” the creature returned sharply, if a bit confused. “I am Griphook. Now, what is it that you wanted?” It was beginning to get impatient.
    “Well, Griphook, I was told to come here if I sought the best service in money, and was wondering if perhaps a relative of mine left an account or something of the sort for me…?” Artemis had started out strong, but as she continued, the creature’s (goblin, was it perhaps?) unmoving expression gave her pause.
    “Your name?”
    “I-ah-I don’t really have one” Artemis mumbled, automatically reaching into her pocket to rub at the worn and rubbed raw material of her Latin book. “The-people who took me in said that my parents never named me, and my-caretakers never really gave me one either, so I just ended up naming myself, eventually. I’m called Artemis,” she finished, peeking through her lashes to soften the blow of the look of utter disbelief she was expecting.
    Instead, what Artemis got was a pithy “follow me, we shall see to your accounts”, and she was off to follow the waddling goblin (Artemis was sure now, after lengthy observation and details from numerous books and tales) down a labyrinthine path filled with too many doors and surprise corners. Finally, Griphook halted in front of a nondescript oak door, and turning sharply on his heel, intoned: “What do you see?”
    The girl started from the abrupt address after minutes of constricting silence, and biting back a dry retort of :“oh, I don’t know, a door perhaps?” acquiesced to the request.
    She peered around Griphook to get a better look at, well, not much at all, until right before her curious eyes, words appeared. In Latin.
    “Matris lingua,” Artemis breathed, enchanted with the swirling and curling loops of that beautiful language. It was only after minutes of admiring, however, that she noticed the words spelled out a phrase; a riddle.

      “When my first is a task to a young girl of spirit,
      And my second confines her to finish the piece,
      How hard is her Fate? But how great is her merit
      If by taking my whole she affects her release!”
      Artemis pondered on the strange puzzle, aware but not wary of Griphook’s disbelieving stare.
        “Conium,” the girl whispered, enraptured when the oak glowed and shuddered, until it seemed to express its approval and swung open without a sound. Artemis stepped through the door, apprehensive but enthralled with the feeling of absolute accomplishment. What she accomplished though, she hadn’t a clue.
      A moment later, Griphook passed Artemis and sat in the small classically styled but not ornate chair provided.  A table, oak and common like the door, was placed in front of the chair, and tapestries of landscapes and- books?-were on the stone walls. The creature looked a bit unwell, to be honest. “Well then,” the goblin started, shakily, but gained confidence, “I believe that answers the question of from where you hail. This is the room of the House of Ravenclaw.” He pierced her with a stare that expected surprise, or incredulity, but was met with a blank face.
      “I suppose that must’ve been a powerful magus?” Artemis questioned tentatively, put-off by the creature’s brief slip of professionalism. Griphook’s mostly blank-but still slightly disbelieving-look answered her thoughts. “I’ve been, er, cut off from this world, so I’m not very familiar with all the…important figures.” Artemis’ moderately panicked silver eyes flicked back and forth between the goblin’s, privately hoping that she wasn’t some sort of long lost granddaughter of Count-whoever.
      “Rowena Ravenclaw was one of the founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and you, are her last heir.” The goblin’s beady eyes were serious and searching, as if trying to find how such a legendary woman could have been the ancestor to the bumbling and too-thin red-haired girl before it.  
      “Ok…then if I am this-founder’s- heir, then that means I should have access to accounts here, correct?” Artemis inquired eagerly. She had money! She could go to the whimsical school with the funny name, and learn all the wonderful magicis and finally, finally be where she belongs, with her people, her gens.
        “Yes, the Ravenclaw Vault will be open to you, if you can prove your heritage, if you would.”
      And with that, the goblin conjured up a dark, granite bowl engraved with peculiar little symbols (runes?) and set it on the table. Next to it, a short dagger appeared, an intaglio of an eagle on its hilt and more runes swirling on its blade. He gingerly picked up the dagger, caressing it as a newborn, and handed it to a cautious Artemis.  “You must give the sacrificial urn a blood offering, and it will discern if you are worthy of the name of Ravenclaw.”
      Brows furrowed, Artemis regarded the urn and dagger with skeptical wonder. She turned the blade in her palm, and without a chance to think, swiftly sliced into her left hand. Droplets of scarlet plopped thickly into the urn, and Artemis watched in avid fascination as the runes on both bowl and dagger flared brilliant sapphire. Griphook motioned to the urn, and Artemis carefully reached into it, pulling out a simple ring of Celtic knots with engravings on the inside.
        “Id est, praeter modum qui est thesaurus,” Artemis read. She looked up inquisitively at the goblin. “’Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure?’”
      “Ravenclaw’s creed, you could say,” Griphook replied. If one would squint, a smile was creeping into Griphook’s black eyes at the wonderment seen in Artemis’. “I do believe that is enough evidence for that. Let’s start with your vaults, then we will attend to your Wizengamot and School board seats, your liquid assets and estates, and finally your libraries.”
      Huge mercurial eyes gaped back at him, burning with questions and curiosities and much, much disbelief. All the poor girl managed was: “I have libraries-as in plural?”

	Two hours later, a distinctly dazed and slightly disheveled Artemis stumbled out of Gringotts Wizarding Bank, thanking caelum for the sense to arrive in Diagon Alley early in the morning. After a trip to her enormous vault, filled to the brim with glittering coins (galleons, Griphook called them) and dusty tomes-deorum, the books!-Artemis had happily left the bank with a bulging pouch of gold attached at the hip and fifteen delicate-looking books that radiated magicis. She’d also gained quite a bit of insight into her past with the help of several tomes, and was honestly, daunted. Founder’s heir she could deal with, but the other? - Well, hopefully no one would find out about the other. A quick reducio for her baggage and she was all set to venture the rest of the vibrant shops lining the cobbled street. Stopping by at Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions and numerous quill, cauldron, and potion supplies stores took no time at all, and while she was practically vibrating with the anticipation to go to Obscurus Books and Flourish and Blotts, she headed to Ollivander's Wand Shop to preserve money. That didn’t stop her from glancing longingly at the shops a she passed though, listening to them whisper their knowledge and secrets conspiratorially.
	Artemis paused in front of Ollivander's, taking in the run down shop tucked between a gaudy cosmetics store and a shop smelling so strongly that the girl suspected it must be a pet store (or pet droppings store). Shaking off that particular train of thought, Artemis opened the faded black door and was greeted with rows upon rows of thin boxes. They were haphazardly piled on shelves, on window sills, on various desks, and some even spilled onto the floor. However, there was no person in sight.
	“Hello?” Artemis called out, cringing at how her voice punctured the quiet like a gunshot. Not even a moment later though, she was too preoccupied examining the man in front of her to mull over her crudeness.
	The man was old, archaic even, with wispy tufts of silvery hair poking out of his head in clumps. His eyes, too large and silver as her own, gazed at her with such intensity she feared he could see into her mind and was viewing her secrets. And those, she had too many to risk.
	“Are you, perhaps, Mr. Ollivander?”
	The old man startled, then smiled knowingly. Artemis was not pleased with his expression.
	“Ah, yes, young Artemis, I must say I have been expecting you for years now. Why is it you have only come now?” Ollivander seemed genuinely curious, and Artemis would’ve believed he had no idea if it weren’t for his twice-damned knowing smile.
	“My letter got lost in the mail,” Artemis said, polite as you please. “I do believe that my owl may have gotten hungry and forgot to deliver it. Funny thing, isn't it?”
	“Quite so, young Artemis.” Again. That thrice-damned smile. “Well, now that you are back amongst your people, I do believe you’ll be needing a wand, is that right?”
	Ollivander set off through the mountains of boxes without another word to her, muttering and glancing at each container contemplatively. He paused every once in a while, then shook his head, mumbled something that sounded like “Of course not, you fool”, and kept on. After fifteen minutes of silence broken only by an old man’s ponderings, Artemis felt she would burst with anticipation.
	“So, um, Mr. Ollivander. What exactly are wands needed for? I mean, isn’t it possible to do magici-er, magic without wands? After all, I just went to Gringotts, and the goblins there didn’t need wands.” She thought it wisest to keep the fact that she had been practicing magicis wandless for over ten years to herself.
	Ollivander trained his eyes on her, distracted from his search and the unheard of question. His head tilted, as if examining a fascinating species of animal, and he answered:
	“Wands are instruments, infused with their own ambient magic, that help wizards and witches to control and direct their magic into spells. Each is made with a specific wood and core specifically suited to a wizard. Every wizard has a wand, and every wand chooses the wizard. Very few can perform any wandless magic, if at all.”
	Well, that certainly wasn’t what she was expecting. How was it that no magus could do magicis without a wand? It was just a magnifier-so it should only be used for difficult spells and charms, right? Artemis voiced her thoughts, becoming increasingly exasperated with her inability to be normal in any aspect.
	“Wizards and witches usually don’t have enough control, or are not in touch enough with their magical core to perform wandlessly. It is a mark of great wizard to be able to…” Ollivander trailed off, looking as if he had just solved Ravenclaw’s riddle. “Great wizard, indeed. One moment….” He scurried around, sifting through boxes, then disappeared behind the farthest shelves. He came back holding a single package, battered, faded, and dusty; but never opened.  “Yes…I had thought when I had made this that it would never be used…more of an experiment, based off fairy tales and dreams…. I should have guessed…..here, young Artemis, try this one.”
	Artemis reached out for the box, feeling along its torn edges and silently asking herself if it really was a good idea to look upon the creation based off “fairy tales and dreams”. Shrugging slightly, she decided that even if the wand didn’t “choose” her, it was still worth seeing.
	The wand sitting in the case was long, thin, and dark as night. Tenebrarum, whispered fleetingly through Artemis’ mind. Designs covered the wand in swirling dizzying patterns, the now familiar Celtic knot stark between multiple spirals and runes. The handle was leather, the weight of the wood comforting and right. Artemis hadn’t even realized she’d picked the wood up.
	“Domus,” she sighed, eyes wide and wild.
</p>
<p>

	“Eleven and a half inches, elder wood, and…thestral tail hair. Yes, I think this wand has finally found its domus. Curious, though. Very curious…” Ollivander considered the girl in front of him, the reverent way in which she held her wand, and a slightly disturbed look graced his face.
	“What?” Artemis questioned distractedly. She tore her gaze from the wood, but never stopped cradling it gently, and turned her focus back to Ollivander. “What’s so curious about it? It’s not like it’s a particularly rare wand or something, is it?” she continued.
	“That wand, “Ollivander started, gaze distant, “is based off of one of legend, one I read of in my youth so many years ago….’fashioned from a near elder tree…a wand worthy of a wizard who has conquered Death of elder, the tree of infinitum, the rarest and trickiest of them all. Both speak of great power, and great destinies.” At this, Ollivander fixed his gaze back on Artemis, a paradoxical look of dread and awe on his lined face. “I’ll be expecting awesome events in the future now, young Artemis. Whether or not they are good or bad, that is your choice.”
	Artemis stared back steadily at Ollivander, unwavering. “The world is not black and white, and there is no good and evil. There is knowledge, and power. ‘Faber est suae quisque fortunae.’ Thank you for the wand Mr. Ollivander.” She handed over seven galleons to the aged man, nodded in thanks, and turned sharply to the door. With a final unsure glance back, Artemis left Ollivander's Wand Shop.
	“’ Faber est suae quisque fortunae’, hmm? I hope so, young one. Fortunam, Artemis Peverell.”
