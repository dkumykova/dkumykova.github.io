	<h1>Heyo this is where I talk about how little talent I have!</h1>
	<p> She was fire in moonlight.
	It was a rite as ancient as the first flame. Once, the One True God could speak directly from the heavens, his tongue lightning, his mouth maelstroms, his voice a thundering cloudburst that turned the sky raw and red, his eye a total eclipse of the sun. But the mind of man grew narrower as the early ages passed, and worship turned from the heavens to body and earth. Soon mankind lost the ability to hear the Voice of God entirely, and even those devout and faithful could only make conjectures as to what the heaving of the mountains and the roaring of the storm could mean. Darkness fell upon the first city of man; decay consumed the temples as they fell into disrepair, and the braziers once lit in prayer burned only with a foul dust that choked the blackening air. Mankind grew lethargic and petty, spoiling families and the most steadfast of friends, driving all to quarreling and mistrust and displeasure. The first city of man, Jezelbelach—a holy city, once shining with the glory of a fallen star, high atop the hill—was dying. </p>
	<p>God knew both mercy and despair, for one remedied the other. He would speak to mankind, he would guide the fragile creatures once more, but the heart of man was closed to him. God required a vessel—a mortal to be His Voice. Only through the mouth of another could God speak. The vessel must be one most worthy, the first city of man decided, one most fitting to be the corporeal manifestation, the permanent theophany of the Exalted, the Glorious, the Sun Among Stars. And what aspect was better suited to spiritual beauty than its physical sister? The first city of man had chosen the vessel of His Voice, and it was to be the most beautiful woman beneath the sky.
		Under this decree, every girl of the bountiful age was gathered before the priests of the crumbling church and laid bare to their God-fearing eyes, until one whose skin was moonlight and whose hair was the golden breath of sun upon snow was chosen. And God was pleased. And God allowed that she serve as the Voice of God, the Oracle, until the day her beauty faded. When that time came and the light fled from her form, she was given a magnificent passing of frosted marble and pale roses. Again was the Festival of Flowers enacted, again were the girls gathered—and this time, one with skin of velvet shadows and eyes like cracked opals was chosen, her fan of peacock hair flaring behind her when God entered her mind and spoke with her mouth.
		Such were the beginnings of this ancient rite. So it was, and so it is now, many kings and kingdoms later, in the High Temple of Jezelbelach, first and last city of man.
	</p>
	<p>Períthragas forever bowed slightly slower than his fellow priests. Where they worked themselves into religious fervor, the sweat a fine sheen on their foreheads as they furiously prostrated, rose, and prostrated, and rose, Períthragas took imperceptible pauses between each dip to the floor, lingering where he knelt—a lonely tower amidst the sea of curved spines. At first glance, his face looked to be shining with rapture; it would seem his movements were unhurried, not out of disrespect, but rather out of a deep and profound veneration for the One True God. Here was a true devout.
	At a second glance—this one longer and more intent than the first—his face looked to be crumbling under the crushing weight of longing. He was pausing, because it gave him a better view of something. What was he looking to? Where were his burning eyes focused with such bottomless yearning? They were turned forward, to the figure languishing at the fore of the prayer hall, suspended among swirling mists and crystal shards because the ground was unfit to be graced by her bare feet. Períthragas was watching the Oracle, Voice of God, the comatose beauty. </p>
	<p>The prayer hall in which Períthragas worshipped was vast and magnificent. Great pillars rose from the floor of the nave to meet the ribbed vaulting, gilded mother-of-pearl mosaics creating a glittering heaven overhead. Sunlight filtered through stained glass windows stretching as tall as the marble columns, rays soft against the rich blues, whites, and golds that told the story of the first Festival of Flowers. The floor, too, told tales of the early ages, when God still spoke. The middle of the central nave was made into a pathway by the cobalt carpet running from the atrium’s embossed doors to the marble stairs of the bema. And at the front of the prayer hall, the Oracle floated in the semicircular apse in shafts of ethereal light, languidly dancing amid the blue smoke, guarded by melting candles lit with azure flame and braziers of burning incense, the marble floor beneath her engraved with a circle of golden sigils to keep the Voice of God safe from otherworldly harms. </p>
	<p>She might have seemed so insignificant, so diminutive against the cathedral’s immensity—a mere doll among the stone titans that reached from the walls and yearned for the heavens, a baby in the domed belly of the apse—but the spherical halo radiating from her drifting form attracted even eyes just emerging from the atrium. And once any mortal laid eyes on the Oracle—the splay of her fingers, the curve of her spine, the tilt of her head thrown back in silent ecstasy, with the moon on her pale skin and the sun in her scarlet hair—all would be burned into memory forever more. It was impossible to escape this mental branding. All persons of the High Temple entered the prayer hall at least thrice a day, if only for the worship of the sun’s positions. Períthragas and his fellow Priests of the Lower Order bowed in the prayer hall three hundred times every day, and spent several hours there besides, in fervent worship. It was argued that lesser priests needed more time close to God, or else their neglected and misguided state would allow for their fall into sin. Períthragas wholeheartedly agreed. He was fully qualified to ascend in rank—but an archbishop or cardinal had no need to frequent the prayer hall, and it would be considered odd if one were to. Períthragas would surely die if he could not every day gaze upon the Oracle in her state of eternal trance.</p>
	<p>Períthragas loved the Oracle. Every man and woman within the walls of the temple loved her. But their love was the same as that which they held for God. Or, if it was otherwise, they dared not say so aloud. Such sinful feelings were grounds for laicization—or worse. Períthragas knew this. It did not dissuade his passion. The love others held was one born from fear, for they looked to the Oracle and saw God. Períthragas beheld the Oracle and was certain his heart would burst from his chest and betray him. Yet, every day he paused between bows, his eyes fixed ahead, the great thumping in his chest as resonant and powerful as the gongs dictating the rhythm of prayer.
		He had watched her since the first day of his priesthood, when Perí Lahtuat—Perí of the Dryland Vast, Perí from Khaíntuohtet, Sand City in the Marble Desert, where molten gold rivers melted against jade shores—became Períthragas and joined the Lower Order. He had been a young lad of barely seven, easily impressionable, timid, and plagued with a sickness only remedied by home. But the Oracle had persuaded him to stay. Períthragas did not suppose she spoke to him directly, for no one had heard any Oracle utter a word since the early ages—and that was only recorded in Scriptures II. Períthragas had convinced himself, however, that the Oracle had pressed upon him a silent plea, and the bottomless cavity that carved opened his chest when he left the prayer hall was a lingering consequence of her sorrow. She needed him, he supposed. So he stayed, and he did not leave, even when the Sand City burned. He stayed, and he aged where she remained immortal, for two long decades.
		His love surely should’ve faded, should’ve mellowed to a chaste fear of God—or should he have grown bitter, his heart weary after twenty seven years of longing from afar, of drawing so close it ached when he realized the infinity that separated him from her? But Períthragas grew neither embittered nor numb. He could not tire of her. Who could tire of her, once they had laid eyes on her? Who could tire of her, once they had seen the fullness of her lips, the slender sinew of her throat, the serenity of her face—and Períthragas imagined her eyes to be sapphire beneath her lashes, if she were ever to open them. Who could tire of her, once they had seen her in sunlight and moonlight? Períthragas had seen her in both; he had seen her in more.
		He had seen her in springtime, her skin radiant in the gentle light, pale in the rain of pink blossoms, the crystals that bound her to this mortal realm turned to pulsing emeralds—and he imagined her skin to be tantalizingly soft, if only he could brush his fingers, so briefly, along the slender length of her bare leg.
		He had seen her in summer, her crimson hair aflame against the swollen sun, her sweet, burning fragrance wafting down the rows of worshippers and turning the air thick, its embrace branding senses and silks until Períthragas could return to his quarters and lay fully clothed, the scent of incense and flowers and foreign spices so strong in his robes he could almost imagine she was laying beside him, setting his flesh afire.
		He had seen her in autumn, coldly beautiful in a season of dying things, and he clung to fantasies of her delicate foot pushing past his lips, of the ghostly chains that loosely trailed from limb to limb choking him as he reeled against the temple floor, mind half-gone with the goddess under the crescent moon.
		He had seen her in winter, the candlelight a blue found only deep beneath the surface of the sea, her crystal cage now diamond in rings around her—and she danced as if she were underwater, a siren alluring and perilous, her scarlet hair sleek, azure smoke trailing in her fingers’ wake. Her every movement beckoned him closer, cried to him from beneath frothing, thrashing waves. And there were rituals, rituals from earlier, primitive kingdoms, when fire was all that warded off the night, and she became Selúnaphé, The Dark Queen, Gilded Empress—and her cage was one of dark mirrors, her bare shoulders draped in chains of gold, her collar encrusted with blood-drenched jewels, her white dress exchanged for a black gown. And she was shimmering starlight draped in darkness. And she was fire in moonlight. And she tormented Períthragas, even in his dreams.
		It was forbidden. It was a crime punishable by death. You did not touch the Oracle. You did not even dream to ever approach the Oracle. You did not touch her. You could not, not according to the Scriptures, and it was divine treason to try. She was as close to God as mortals would ever come—had ever come, since the days God fell silent—and to touch her would be to lay hands on the One True God, the Exalted, the Glorious, Himself. But Períthragas did not trust himself. If he were ever to find himself kneeling before the silent Voice of God, alone in the vast darkness of the prayer hall, he did not think he could halt the yearning reach of his arm or still the throes of his heart. But the prayer hall was always locked at night; there was no fear of trespassers when the rest of the temple slept.
	</p>
	<p>There were nights when the wastelands burned. But tonight, it was still and cold.
		The High Temple was atop a hill, soaring high above the city. The lands beyond the city walls could be seen from the temple’s flowered arcades, the earth cracked and ruined against the pristine marble of Jezelbelach. In the distance, the Mountains of Asodamus clung to the horizon and the last vestiges of their majesty, the craters now pockmarking the massifs shrouded in a foul haze. Somewhere beyond the crumbling peaks, the other cities of man could have been collapsing, decaying, or nonexistent. Períthragas did not know. He had not left the High Temple since his first day of priesthood, and had only watched from afar when the first orbs of fire streaked down from the ashen sky and swallowed the countryside whole. The people of Jezelbelach called that day the Wrath of God, the Great Calamity, when the glorious, punitive fist of the divine smote down all sinners—and the people of Jezelbelach had rejoiced, for they had been spared. The people of the other cities called it nothing at all, for they all had perished. These people did not rejoice. Períthragas did not rejoice either. He knew the people of Jezelbelach. He did not know why God would spare them.
		Períthragas watched the wastelands now as he paced down the hallway, restless and sleepless, soft footsteps whispering against marble. The face of a ruined moon stretched for as far as the eye could see, unearthly shadows drifting over scorched craters and sliding into grinning chasms, the darkness as broken as the landscape it sought to devour. Black clouds clung to the horizon, prelude to a tempest. Períthragas did not linger on this scene for too long—it brought him more sadness than the serenity priests were meant to strive for—instead continuing down the hall.
		It was a lonely hall, made even emptier by the moonlight. White curtains billowed inwards, filled by a cold wind heralding the storm, the flowers woven along the colonnade glistening jewel-like as if sisters to the stars. The wall to the left was decorated by a sprawling fresco, painted angels dancing among gilded clouds as the wheels of heaven turned for a frozen eternity. The lips of the seraphim were parted, and Períthragas often imagined the heavenly creatures to be singing when he passed by the wall. Even now, as he neared the mural’s end, he could almost hear a melody in the whistle of the wind as it rushed through his robes and scurried across the floor. In fact—and here Períthragas paused—he could have almost sworn he had heard actual singing.
		He turned slowly. He was certain he had just heard a lilting voice in the moan of the wind. Admittedly, it had been quiet, unobtrusive, as elusive as the glimmer of spider’s silk in sunlight—but the tune seemed hauntingly familiar though Períthragas had never heard it before. And who could be singing? It was too late for the altar boys’ hymns or the choir, and surely Períthragas would have remembered a woman with a voice so pure and sweet. Something in his chest twisted and tightened and demanded that he follow the song to its singer, the same gaping emptiness that led him to priesthood urging his feet away from the priests’ quarters and back down the hallway. The silvery voice teased his ears and beckoned him to follow—an aural nymph dancing from pillar to wall to floor, away from him and around the corner before gathering in a shadowed doorway Períthragas had often seen but never truly noticed. It led to a passageway used by the women who maintained the prayer hall’s candlelight and braziers, giving the flames the illusion of permanence; it was of equal importance that the flames never die and all prayers go uninterrupted, so subtle chambers and secret tunnels were made within the temple walls, allowing the Women of Flame to fulfill the two sacred requirements. Períthragas had glimpsed one of the women, once, when the other priests bowed and he gazed at the Oracle. She had been draped in dark robes, a shadow among shadows as she moved, dream-like, from candle to brazier to candle—and when she whispered to the dying flames, they flared brighter and lived once more. Hers was a thankless job, but not a lonely one and not without comfort, for the Women of Flame shared in their own unspoken pleasures with one another and were bound by a common sisterhood as eternal as the fires they tended. Períthragas often envied them and their intimacy—and how near to the Oracle they were allowed to pass. To think! Had he only been a woman, how close he would have been to the Voice of God, every day, every hour. But Períthragas was sure such tantalizing nearness would drive him mad.
		The song briefly rose above the groaning wind, shrill and summoning Períthragas into the darkened doorway, into the domain of the Women of Flame—and there was no fear of discovery here, for even the Flame Keepers had rituals to attend, when the rest of the temple slept. Períthragas ducked into the passageway and followed it into shadow and into candlelight, finally coming to a halt before a narrow, wrought iron door. It opened at his slightest touch, swinging forward and allowing him into a cavernous hall. He inhaled sharply. The wind-borne song was fond of cruel jokes, it seemed; the mischievous wraith of a melody had led Períthragas into the prayer hall—throne room of his passion and torment.
		Outside, beyond the stained glass windows, dark clouds gathered and waited and watched.
		Períthragas slowly straightened and marveled. The prayer hall had always seemed large to him, but without the thousand rows of prostrated priests, in the absence of their murmurs, the silent emptiness of the hall became infinitely vast—a universe unto itself. Períthragas looked upon the ribbed vaulting, gazed upon moonlight turned blue, and thought himself to be in the excavated belly of a prehistoric titan who had once eaten worlds, deep beneath the sea. And then he turned his attention forward and knew himself to be in heaven, for there floated the Oracle in her column of ethereal light, so beautifully and terribly alone.
	He knew he should turn away. He knew he should return to the hallway, return to his quarters, murmur his prayers and fall back into listless slumber as he did every day—but he could not. He could not. He could not. Too long had he watched from afar. He could not, not any longer.  </p>
	<p>The candlelight flickered as Períthragas approached. With every step, his heart grew heavier, its tremulous beat like thunder in his ears, until he was certain his chest would rupture with the emotions writhing within him and strangling his thoughts. He faltered as he climbed the bema’s marble steps, his knees weakening as he inhaled the sweet fragrance that so often haunted his dreams. He almost collapsed as he neared the Oracle’s golden circle of protections where it glistened on the ground. He was drowning. He could not breathe. The world had grown hot; his robes were choking him, and he imagined hands gripping its back and his arms and his neck, pulling him away from the girl sleep-dancing in the moonlight. He tripped and fell to the floor, finally succumbing to the fire and weakness spreading through him. He was so close, so close to her, to the Voice of God—no, he could not think of God. He could not think of laws and sins and punishment and Hell. How could he, kneeling at the edge of the ring of crystals slowly orbiting her floating form? How could he turn back now, having come so close to his greatest desire? Períthragas slowly stood on shaking legs. He was so near—and nothing had come in his way. Nothing but golden runes on the ground and drifting azure jewels, and those were poor cages indeed.
		And what of the two gargantuan statues, one to either side, that stood sentinel and towered over the Oracle? Eidoloch and Alamorcses, Alam and Eid, the Oracle’s divine guardians consecrated to her protection—what did these marble colossi do? Períthragas had been told their helms would blaze with radiant fire if the Oracle were ever threatened, that six wings would bloom from their armor and lions’ heads covered in burning eyes would erupt from their gilded pauldrons, the spears as tall as the prayer hall itself swinging down to part any trespasser’s head from body. But when Períthragas finally parted the cage of floating crystals with a shaking hand, his foot slipping over the edge of the circle of golden runes—nothing happened. The skies did not shatter, as every priest had been warned. Serpents did not spill from between the statues’ lips. Still, Períthragas stared up at Eidoloch, awaiting retribution. The sculpture’s eyes were lost in shadow, but he imagined the guardian to be watching him, silent and imperious and disapproving. He could almost feel the heat of the sentinel's gaze. But neither Eidoloch nor Alamorcses made any move to halt him. Períthragas slowly moved his other foot into the circle. Sweat rolled down his brow and his back, turning his robes damp and suffocating. He waited, his muscles aching, paralyzed with fear. And nothing happened. The crystal ring closed behind him. And nothing happened.
		Distant thunder rolled over the mountains, and the dark clouds shivered in anticipation.
		And before Períthragas, there floated the Oracle.
		Her dress—filmy gossamer, white and unblemished—hung from her suspended form, trailing in the wake of her languid movements. Períthragas drew closer, heart pounding. He had seen this dress before, seen it so many times from the back of the prayer hall. From over the backs of a thousand bowing priests, it had appeared to be brilliant and shimmering among the candles, a fallen star amid fire. But now, from a mere step away, it seemed worn. Faded. The threads no longer caught the light. Períthragas decided that this could not be the dress he had seen sparkling from afar. Surely this was a different one—nightwear, perhaps, and not so impressive. His gaze left the dress and roamed along her bare skin. His stomach twisted in guilt, and he felt lecherous and unclean, yet he could not tear his eyes away. From her slender legs. Her elegant neck. Her skin. Her skin. Her skin. He was certain her skin had been whiter than snow, pure and wholesome and luminous. He had seen her in springtime, had seen how radiant her skin had been against the rain of rosy blossoms. Why was it so thin, now? So pale it was almost translucent? He could see a spider web of blue veins spreading under her eggshell skin, cracks in a sickly porcelain doll. Spots—watermarks of brown—dusted the backs of her hands and the hollow of her neck.
		Períthragas knew these imperfections were merely tricks of the light.
		The grey streaks through her scarlet hair must have been a fault in the lighting, too. Surely the silver of the moonlight was deceiving his eyes. The crimson of her hair should have been beautiful. He had seen her in summer, had seen how vibrantly her head of fire had blazed against the late-setting sun. Her curtain of hair was meant to be thick, luxuriant, a bloom of blood and flame and yet—and yet—the colour of passion and rage seemed so wan from so close, a fading blush more suited to hollowness and ashen decay.
		Períthragas reached out with a shaking hand, to brush her hair from her face. He was not meant to touch her—he knew that—but he simply wanted to see her face. He would never harm her. He was hardly touching her. Only her hair, only a few brittle—they were meant to be silky, he knew that—strands. Beauty lay in the face—he knew that. He had gazed upon her visage from afar for two decades. He knew he would find beauty in her face.
		The first things his eyes lighted upon were her lips. Her lips were thin. Not the thinness of a natural kind, but one born when something is lost. They had no form, these lips. The ruby paint that coated them did not add any definition, and leaked into the crevices of her cracked skin, creating glistening canyons. They did not look soft, these lips. They could not be the Oracle’s, these lips.
		Períthragas recoiled slightly. The distant serenity of her face had been shattered, run through with thin blue veins, replaced by a pale void without expression. Where had her tranquility gone? The wistful, angelic suggestion of a sigh that had forever graced her lolling head—where was it now? He looked upon the Oracle, and saw a paper doll. Empty. Flat.
		But surely her skin was soft.
		He reached out with a trembling hand. To touch the Oracle was forbidden, he knew that—but he had already come so far. He had come so close. And nothing had stopped him. Nothing had even tried. Not Eidoloch or Alamorcses, the fateful Alam and Eid who now paid for their original evils by keeping watching over the Voice of God. Not the circle of protections glittering on the ground, not the crystals spinning in slow orbit. Períthragas wondered if God would stop him, would help him, would save him from the sin he was about to commit. But if God was watching, he made no protest. If God was watching, he did not seem to care.
		Períthragas remembered the day flaming shards fell from the sky and shattered the earth. God had not seemed to care then, either. Períthragas could almost see the falling suns now, their descent cutting through the dark clouds with a shriek—or was that the wind now—as his hand reached for the Oracle, her skin the pale and innocent—blemished, broken beyond repair—earth, and the divine fist of God made contact—
		Her skin.
		It was so cold.
		Even the vindictive wrath of God could not warm her skin. And as the earth ruptured and the cities of man collapsed in his memory, Períthragas dragged his fingers along the length of the Oracle’s arm, shivering. Flesh, meant to be tender, seemed to shrivel beneath his touch.
		Her skin was like ice.
		And stretched tight over bone; he could see her ribs protruding from beneath her dress, angular edges clawing through the worn garment. Her muscles had withered and atrophied, fat detached and scarce.  
		Two decades.
		For two decades, he had loved a corpse.
		No. No. She was the Oracle. She was beautiful. He knew she was. He had seen her in sunlight and moonlight. He had seen her in more. The softness of her skin in spring. The fire of her hair in summer. She had been so beautiful in autumn—so coldly exquisite in a season of dying things. She could not be a dying thing herself.
		His hand drifted to her eyes, fingers fluttering over her thin lashes. Gently, he lifted one eyelid; he had imagined her eyes to be sapphire, as vivid as a flash of lightning, fathomless and brilliant. Instead, he was met with the colour of a dead, hazy, stagnant sea. 
		His hand slid to her abdomen. He held his own breath, listening for the Oracle’s. But he never heard it. It never came. Only the sound of thunder cracking open the clouds as it began to rain.
		The Oracle was dead. And the lands beyond Jezelbelach, locked in his memory, burned and burned and burned.
