MAIDEN
 
I had gazed into the eyes of the divine and seen only a thousand Hells. I had given my love to the voice of the gods themselves and so condemned myself to stone. Thankless, emotionless, unchanging stone. Whipped by the weather, caressed by the stream, unwilling seat and stool and throne.
Still, my skin is soft. See how softly I lay there, as if asleep, but not breathing? My skin is tender. See how tenderly I clasp those flowers? Those stupid flowers. What a garish colour. Doesn’t complement my skin at all. And what a meaningless gesture besides—to place a bouquet of colour in the hands of my lifeless form, to change it every week, to comb my golden tresses and arrange it in braids. Does he actually expect me to wake up? What a futile exercise.
<p>
I don’t know where he came from.
It’s been so long, I can barely even remember the days when I actually knew what it was like to live. To breathe. To move. To speak, to laugh, to love! Sometimes, though, I do catch fragments—surreptitious glances into another girl’s life like the thief peering through a keyhole. In that life, the girl is happy. She is content. She knows of speech, of laughter, of love. She is not trapped, suspended in an eternal dream, lying in a crystal coffin lined with gold and teardrop jewels. Never has she beaten her fist against the unfeeling confines of her own mind, never has she torn at her own consciousness, never has she silently screamed and raged and frothed at an unmoving mouth—
Sometimes, I do remember.
And then I wish I didn’t. A slave who has only ever known slavery cannot fathom the concept of freedom. One who does not know there is more to want for never will.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know where he came from.
One day, he just sort of…showed up. All dressed in black, a dark pillar, a bloody ruby sparkling at one finger and malevolent emerald—the colour of envy and a sick death—on the other. He had moved across the bedroom, footsteps echoing timidly amongst the exposed rafters above. The light had fallen on his face, but it illuminated only shadow and a collection of harsh, angular features that would’ve been handsome on anyone else but only made him seem more foreign than before. He had approached my bedside, quietly murmuring a hesitant greeting. Of course I didn’t reply. Finally, disquieted by my unnatural stillness, he had…well…he had just sort of stood there awkwardly. I don’t think he quite knew what to do. Perhaps the Fates had not properly groomed him for this foretold event of his predicted life. Not that it mattered, anyways. He wasn’t the One.
Not the One I’m supposed to wait for.
No, he’s the Sharp-Eyed Guardian, the Envious Watcher. Not the One I’m supposed to wait for.
As if I had a choice to wait or not.
Eventually, I think he did gather me in his arms (and by “eventually,” I mean “after waiting uncertainly for a very long time while I screamed noiselessly at him to do something besides stand there and look like a dunce”), carrying me from my bed to the glass coffin in which I now reside—from one prison to another. Perhaps he thought a mattress of soft feathers would be more comfortable than the rigid wooden frame I had previously reclined against. Did he actually think I could feel? Beware! I feel only flame, and it burns whatever I dare touch—burns it to the ground in a swift spasm of violence and feeds on the pulsing organs of pleasure! Look now at the crimson trails of carnage spilling from my lips! I consume, for I am the voluptuous Abaddon, I am the World-Eater, and in my womb I nurture fury! Look now at the tears welling at the corners of my closed eyes—and see how they form but do not fall, for I stopped caring about pain a long time ago. Now the tears are just there for sympathy. For I feed on that too.
Do you know how many others have come begging after my hand? It’s almost ironic, in some sick and twisted way; even in this false-death, even in this tormented slumber, princes and kings and dashing young farm lads still come to woo me, certain it will be their one kiss that will awaken me and that all will end happily ever after.
They never reach me.
</p>
<p>
None of them ever have. None of them ever will. And I know this, because I have spent near to a century hearing their gallant steeds gallop up to the mansion’s door, and hearing the door creak open, and hearing their confident stride echo through the halls—and hearing their cries of anguish as the vile thorns guarding my chambers tear them apart. Some escape, blind and bleeding but still alive…but most don’t.
He reached me, though.
Of course he reached me. The Fates themselves had parted the curtain of death for him, had allowed him to approach my bedside, had quietly chuckled to themselves as all the little pawns and pieces fell into place just as they were designed to. His walk had not been at all confident. Even to this day, he still tiptoes around me, flinching at every unnecessary echo. Does he actually think a loud noise might accidentally awaken me? If that had been the case, the entire kingdom would’ve already been ringing with the sound of very large objects being dropped from very high places, and every musician would’ve suddenly found himself in employment as orchestra after orchestra assembled itself to assault my ears with a cacophony of sound.
Still. I find his antics…endearing.
Is that the right word?
Perhaps I’m just pairing familiar words with forgotten emotions, hoping one fits with the other without much complaint. A sudden need to scream? Must be love. A sudden urge to break something—anything—and furiously beat my hands against impassable stone walls in hope that someone—anyone—will hear? Must be happiness. A sudden desire to swallow the world in fire and inflict a terrible, terrible pain upon innocence? Obviously sexual frustration.
I wish I could melt, but instead I only grow colder and laugh.
</p>
<p>
He has no attendants. He combs my hair himself, braids my hair himself, polishes the coffin and replaces the flowers all by himself. He used to have a terrible time with the braiding part, but I think he’s gotten better. The side-buns really don’t look good on me at all, though.
I sometimes wonder if he ever grows lonely.
He speaks to me sometimes. Sits by my side and spins poetry and pleas, seducing the air and silence. Does he actually think I can hear him? I can, but—does he think I’ll ever respond? A flutter of an eyelid, a stirring breath, the rustle of cloth—is that what he’s waiting for? Or is this the only way he can retain his sanity?
He sits by my side, and says, “Please.”
And then, “Please open your eyes.”
“Please open those beautiful blue eyes and look at me. Can you hear me? Look at me. I want to see your eyes.”
And I say, no, I cannot. I say, no, it was not meant to be. I say, no, that is not what the Fates have decided for me.  
Fate. What is fate? An indulgent mistress and affectionate nymph to those she favours—but be you accursed in her eyes and you will be born marked and damned. Once, I was her favourite. Once she showered me with gifts; I was sweet and witty and charming and glittering with youthful glamour. I had not been wealthy, true, I had come from a small village, I had no education—but one does not need riches when one is as beautiful as I. Once upon a time, I could’ve married a prince. I could’ve been a queen. At least, that’s what I thought.
But, no longer.
Some nights I dream—I do not sleep, but I dream like one remembers—and I see a great marble mansion, all of white and gold. And there is a boy. The boy has strange eyes. The boy is a prophet. The boy pours me tea; we speak of politics and the weather.
</p>
<p>
The prophet refills the teapot.
We speak of fates and gods.
The prophet refills the teapot.
We speak of love.
</p>
<p>
But my mission is not to find love. My parents have sent me to the city to have my future foretold, my destiny determined by the young oracle that lived in the palace of marble and gold. I am supposed to be rescued by a hero—at least, that’s what all the girls at the convent had told me—and ride off into the sunset on the back of his horse, not marry this eccentric recluse who spoke in the tongue of the divine.
I ask the prophet to tell me my future.
The oracle stares into my eyes—for that is how his Sight works, he tells me; I find it fascinating, the power in those mismatched eyes of his—and then his gaze falters and he looks away.
I ask him to tell me what he saw, but the god-speaker refuses.  
I’m insistent.
Only when I’m on the verge of tears does he finally relent. He holds my hands in his, but he won’t look into my eyes. Instead, the fate-bearer stares down at our entwined fingers and tells me my life will be long and happy.
</p>
<P>
The prophet lied.
The prophet lied.
</p>
<p>
Was this truly the end you had chosen for me, cruel Fates? I had been so sure I was destined to walk the same path as my sister—I had been convinced I too would play the distressed damsel, certain I too would be rescued from the evil lord, assured I too would have my happily ever after. Was that not what you had designed for me? Or is this a punishment? Is…is this a punishment? I’ve done nothing to deserve this! I was a good girl! I did as I was told! Bare my soul before the gods and you will find no stain of sin!
Or perhaps this punishment was not designed to punish me…
Some nights I dream—and I remember cursing the oracle, that false prophet, in those last seconds before I was bound to eternal sleep.
But that was a long time ago.
Time. What is time? I know it only as that bountiful well from which I draw sustenance every day, until I am drunk on this half-life and the years shrivel into hours. Time. A flighty mistress she is, even to those who covet her company—but if she is your only companion, she soon becomes a lethargic harpy.
I stay too long in her presence.
And in his.
I have loved and burned. If I love again, I will surely perish.
</p>
<p>
He does play his part well, though. He tries, at the very least. He chases the other princes and potential husbands away with dark magics and hellfire. He cackles evilly when puppies are in pain. He paces mysteriously along the battlements, a dark pillar, shrouded in shadows and bats—and then he ruins it all by inviting the princes back for tea; he nurses the puppies back to health before gifting them to the young children of the nearby village; he trips on his long dark robes and tumbles off the battlements, leaving the shadows and bats to swirl about uncertainly in his wake.
I think destiny made a mistake. I think they chose the wrong Dark Lord, mixed up the hapless farm boy with the heartless villain. I do not know whose fault this is, the prophet’s or the Fates’, but whoever is responsible—they done goofed this time.
But still, he tries. He tries so hard. And for what?
We all know the villain dies in the end.
But still, he tries. Sometimes I wonder why. Why doesn’t he abandon his life of darkness? Why doesn’t he run away? He knows how this story ends—why does he stay to see his death fulfilled? He can leave, unlike me. He is not trapped in sleep, unlike me. He is not motionless and unbreathing, unlike me. He can leave, goddamnit, why isn’t he leaving?!
Oh. Look. Now he’s weaving ribbons into my hair. Now he’s singing quietly to himself. I want to scream at him, tell him to run far, far away—for the hero is coming! The Chosen One is coming!
I also want to tell him to stop singing, because he’s terribly out of tune.
Look at me. How soft, how tender, silent and still.
I am perishing.
</p>
<p>
Look at me…
I am the favourite of the Fates. I am sweet and witty and charming and glittering with youthful glamour. I am not rich—but one does not need to be born rich if you are destined to marry a hero. For the hero will become a prince, I a princess, and then we will be king and queen. This is the end the kind Fates have chosen for me. I am destined to walk the same path as my sister, and my mother, and her mother before her—I too shall play the distressed damsel. I too shall be rescued from the evil lord. I too shall have my happily ever after. This is what was designed for me. I am a good girl. I do as I am told. Bare my soul before the gods and you will find no stain of sin. I am beautiful, for I am the forgiving Archangel, the Innocent Lamb, and in my heart I nurture sweet sorrow.
“Please, I want to see your eyes,” he says.
You will never see my eyes, I say. When my eyes open, you will already be gone.
He is not evil. I don’t think he’s even capable of being evil, no matter how hard he tries.
Fate and Time. Things without emotion or thought. Mindless clockworks, an inexhaustible machine, Time and Fate, the puppet masters.
They are evil.
